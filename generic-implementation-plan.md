## Customization Notes

When adapting this plan for specific projects:

1. **Adjust Phase 2-3** based on site complexity (e-commerce, blog, portfolio, etc.)
2. **Modify Phase 4** based on required features (search, user accounts, etc.)
3. **Customize Phase 5** based on backend needs (CMS, database, etc.)
4. **Update dependencies** based on specific requirements
5. **Add project-specific steps** as needed

This plan works best for:
- Business websites
- Portfolio sites
- Service-based companies
- Small e-commerce sites
- Landing pages
- Marketing websites
